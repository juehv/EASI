EASI Easy And Simple Intranet Manager
This is a Network Observation and Management Tool for Admins.

The Features are:
o List a given Host DB
o Ping the Host
o Auto Ping all Hosts
o Scan the Network for active Hosts
o Send a WOL Magic Packet
o Start a RDP Session
o Some autocorretions

Soon with HostExecutionServer:
o Shutdown a Host
o Show some Details about the Host
o Show Details about Processes and Software of the Host
o Get Macadress of the Host

Currently designed for Windows Hosts but should work with Linux / Mac except the RDP

The project is a quick and dirty weekend project --> early alpha status.
